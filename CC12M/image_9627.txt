Motion Example -- Constant Acceleration A constant force is applied The acceleration is a constant Value depends on the total force exerted on (and mass of) the object The value is equal to the slope of the line on the v-t graph The velocity is changing On the graph, this is an upward sloping straight line The position is changing Not the same change each second On the graph, this is a curved line Section 3.1
