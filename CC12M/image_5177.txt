When it's chilly outside and you need to keep out drafts, add extra layering of colour coordinated drops behind the bed. These make for an interesting change and can be packed away when summer returns. Adding this type of window treatment also make a small bedroom feel cosy and warm, with panels of fabric that envelop the space.
