Nine Square Grid - Participants chose a white card--in this case, ``business accelerator''--and then selected black cards to identify their priorities in relation to the white card. Higher-priority black cards were moved to the squares adjacent to the white card. From this exercise, we learned that programming, training, and community engagement are at least as important as physical and spatial qualities of a business accelerator.
