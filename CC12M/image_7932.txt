Week 4 Big week on the homestead. We have begun weaning the puppies with ground up puppy food and puppy formula. They are doing great and have been lapping up water also. They have also attempted to take on some of mom's kibble that fell on the ground, so that got picked up quickly. They are gaining weight quickly and becoming more playful by the day. <PERSON> took a roll in the grass tonight. She is so happy to be out by herself for a few minutes.
