<PERSON>: If I could afford the exclusive 911 Speedster in the first place, I'd spare no expense and grab the $24,510 Heritage Design package. While this requires GT Silver Metallic paint and a Black and Cognac leather interior, it enhances the convertible's retro vibe. Sure, the white-painted front bumper and circular emblems can be deleted for free, but this Porsche fan prefers the pageantry, however silly it may appear. Besides, the alternative paint colors are just as gaudy. I'd also choose the Satin Platinum wheels and the $2900 black-trimmed LED headlights for a more sinister look.
