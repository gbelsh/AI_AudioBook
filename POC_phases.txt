Phase 1: Basic Image Generation

    Model Selection: Begin with a model that can generate images from text. This could be a pre-trained model like OpenAI's DALL-E or a custom Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) or Variational Autoencoder (VAE).

    Dataset Preparation: Prepare a dataset where you have textual descriptions and corresponding images. This dataset doesn't need to consider the contextual continuity at this stage.

    Training and Refinement: Train your model on this dataset and refine it until it can reliably generate relevant images from text descriptions.

    Evaluation: Develop metrics to assess the quality and relevance of the generated images.

Phase 2: Incorporating Context and Memory

    Contextual Data Preparation: Start preparing your data in a way that includes contextual information. For books, this might mean segmenting the text into chapters or scenes and including previous context.

    Model Adaptation: Modify your model or its training process to take into account the broader context. This could involve:
        Integrating a transformer-based NLP model to better understand the text.
        Using techniques like attention mechanisms to allow the model to refer back to earlier parts of the text.

    Memory Mechanisms: Experiment with memory mechanisms such as LSTM, GRU, or even more complex architectures like Neural Turing Machines (NTM) or Differentiable Neural Computers (DNC) to maintain context throughout the book.

    Iterative Training: Train your model on this enriched dataset, focusing on its ability to maintain context. This will likely involve a lot of experimentation and fine-tuning.

    Advanced Evaluation: Develop more complex evaluation metrics to assess not just the quality of individual images, but also the consistency of images in the same context or storyline.
