A large part of the shared classified supercomputing capability at AFRL's Department of Defense Supercomputing Resource Center is four state-of-the-art HPE SGI 8600 supercomputers, including this one named ``Mustang,'' an unclassified supercomputer named in honor of the P-51 Mustang aircraft flown by the famous Tuskegee Airmen. The three other systems, Voodoo, Shadow, and Spectre, named after the F-101 supersonic jet fighter, MC-130P Combat Shadow, and AC-130H gunship, respectively, support higher classification levels that impact critical DOD research areas and address increasing demand across the Defense Department.
