Men, women and children throng the kitchen at Bangla Sahib, one of the biggest gurudwara in India, brewing soupy dishes in gigantic metal pots, rolling mounds of dough and flipping breads on mesh-topped stoves. The community meal, which runs into the evening, feeds more than 10,000 people every day. (AP Photo/ <PERSON>)
