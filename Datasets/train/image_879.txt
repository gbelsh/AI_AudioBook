'The other day I did some research on Apsara for my previous artwork and I never notice that the headpiece looks like flowers like real flowers so I started working on this with some sketches idea and this is my favorite one. I have a lot of fun doing this, probably I will make this to series. #procreate #crown #flower #apsara #dancer'
