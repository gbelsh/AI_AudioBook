A cardboard cutout sits in the window of a home in a village on the outskirts of Hoyerswerda. The village is scheduled to be demolished so that the mining company, Vattenfall, can begin mining coal where the village stands. The coal company has built a duplicate town 6 miles from the original town and use the cutouts to attract potential residence.
