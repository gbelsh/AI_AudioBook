Local hikers <PERSON> (purple) and <PERSON> survey the approach to Peak Four (12,866 feet) from the summit of Peak Three (12,676 feet). The 0.75-mile stretch between the two peaks is deceptively difficult, featuring either a razor-thin ridgeline traverse or a descent on a west-facing boulder field before an ascent to the summit.
